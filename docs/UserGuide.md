TutHub is a **desktop app for NUS School of Computing professors who have to keep track of hundreds of teaching assistant/tutor profiles and monitor their performance and track records but have little time to spare for tedious administrative work. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/senior`, `t/senior t/great` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
