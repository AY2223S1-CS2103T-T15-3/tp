TutHub is a **desktop app for NUS School of Computing professors who have to keep track of hundreds of teaching assistant/tutor profiles and monitor their performance and track records but have little time to spare for tedious administrative work.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Tuthub, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Tuthub, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
