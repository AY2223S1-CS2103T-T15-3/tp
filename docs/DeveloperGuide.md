## **Introduction**
Welcome to the Developer Guide for **Tuthub**, a Command Line Interface (CLI) App that will help you find your next batch of teaching assistants (TA) in no time! Tuthub is a desktop app for NUS professors who wish to track and choose their next batch of teaching assistants/tutors based on their past performance and records but have little time to spare for tedious administrative work.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TutorListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Tutor` object residing in the `Model`.

In addition to the third point above, the `CommmandExecutor` functional interface, initially encapsulated inside the `CommandBox` class, was abstracted out to allow multiple `UI` components to communicate with the `Logic` component. The `CommandExecutor` is first created in `MainWindow` and passed down to `CommandBox` and `TutorListCard` to keep a link to `Logic` for the components to execute a command.

![Implementation of UI Parts](images/CommandExecutorClassDiagram.png)

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TuthubParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a tutor).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TuthubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TuthubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores tuthub data i.e., all `Tutor` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tutor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutor>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Tuthub`, which `Tutor` references. This allows `Tuthub` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Tutor` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both tuthub data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TuthubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tuthub.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Feature

Tutor information is stored as `Tutor` objects, which captures all the information that the tutor represents. When the user adds a tutor, the program creates a new `Tutor` object with the given information and adds it to the `ObservableList` to be displayed in the program. The `Model` class handles the checking of uniqueness while the `Storage` class handles the conversion of the `Tutor` object to a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format and updating of the storage file in `{source_root}/data/Tuthub.json`.

The following methods in `Tuthub` manage the addition of tutors:
* `Tuthub#AddCommand(Tutor tutor)` - Adds the provided tutor to the list of tutors created
* `Tuthub#AddCommandParser(String args)` - Parses the command `add` and determines the attributes of the `Tutor` object created based on the given prefixes

Given below are the different steps taken when the user adds tutors.

Step 1: The user enters the command word add, followed by the prefixes and information that they want to store. Example: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/CS2100 y/3 s/A0123456X tn/1 r/5.0 t/senior`.

Step 2: The program makes use of `TuthubParser` to make sense of the keyword and determine which parser to use to parse the arguments. In this case, the `AddCommandParser` is used.

Step 3: The `AddCommandParser` makes sense of the arguments through the use of the prefixes, with the help of `ParserUtil`, and creates an `AddCommand` object with the provided information in the form a `Tutor` object.

Step 4: The `AddCommand` object is executed. The `Tutor` object created in step 3 is added to the list of tutors captured in the `ModelManager` class, which then utilises the `UI` class to display the created `Tutor` object.

Step 5: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object contained the success message to be displayed to the GUI to the user.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):

![AddSequenceDiagram](./images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Extra information on how `ModelManager` handles adding of tutors:

The `ModelManager` class calls on the `addTutor` method of `Tuthub`, which calls on the `add` method of the `UniqueTutorList` currently present in Tuthub. `UniqueTutorList` enforces the checking of uniqueness before the tutor is added and displayed in the `observableList`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations:

![AddSequenceModelDiagram](./images/AddSequenceModelDiagram.png)

<ins>Design considerations</ins>:

**Aspect: Implementation of `add`**
- **Alternative 1:** Add the tutor to a list that is maintained by the `Model` class **(chosen)**
  - Pros: Tutor can be viewed in the GUI once added without requiring any additional reading from storage.
  - Cons: More complex implementation of `add` needed due to requirement for both adding to model and storage.
- **Alternative 2:** Add the tutor directly to the `Storage` class as a JSON object
  - Pros: Less memory needed to store an extra list, especially when there would be a large number of tutors
  - Cons: The `Storage` class would be handling both storing of the Tuthub file and providing of the list to the UI, which would violate OOP principles.

### Find Feature

This feature filters TutHub's filtered list of tutors based on a predicate on whether a tutor's attribute contains the keywords
being searched. User are to specify which attribute of the tutor to search for by including the prefix of the attribute when using the command.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `find` command involves the logic, model and UI components of Tuthub.
Tutor information is stored in a `Tutor` object, where each piece of information is an object on its own.
E.g. `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`. When the user wants to find a tutor, the user specifies the `Prefix` corresponding
to the specific attribute of the tutor followed by the keywords to be searched. `Tutor` objects that are matched the
keywords being searched are added to the `FilteredList` to be displayed in the program to the user.

The following methods in `tuthub` manage the finding of tutors:
* `tuthub#FindByNameCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with names matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByPhoneCommand(PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with phone number matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByEmailCommand(EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with emails matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByModuleCommand(ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with modules matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByYearCommand(YearContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with year matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByStudentIdCommand(StudenIdContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with student ids matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByTeachingNominationCommand(TeachingNominationContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with teaching nominations matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByRatingCommand(RatingContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with rating matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByTagCommand(TagContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with tags matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `tuthub#FindByPrefixParser(String args)` - Parses the `find` command and determines the `prefix` corresponding to the attribute to search through to find matching tutors
* `ModelManager#filteredTutors` - A `javafx.collections.transformation.FilteredList` that contains a list of filtered tutors according to a predicate
* `ModelManager#getFilteredTutorList()` - Returns the `filteredTutors` list
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredTutorList(Predicate<Tutor> predicate)` - Updates filtered list based on predicate

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user is finding tutors whose names contain alex.

Step 1: The user enter the command `find n/alex`.

Step 2: TutHub uses `TuthubParser` to determine which parser to use based on the command input by the user. In this case, `FindByPrefixParser` is used to parse the `find` command.

Step 3: `FindByPrefixCommandParser` parses the `find` command to determine the attribute to search through and the keywords input by the user.
`FindByPrefixCommandParser` creates a `FindByNameCommand` that extends `FindByPrefixCommand` with the keywords put into a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

Step 4: The `FindByNameCommand` is executed and tutors with names containing the string alex are added to the filtered list of tutors that have names
containing the string alex captured in the `ModelManager` object, which makes use of the `UI` class to display the matching tutors.

Step 5: The execution ends, returning a `CommandResult` object that has the success message to be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):
![FindSequenceDiagram](./images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: Implementation of `find`**
- **Alternative 1:** `find` command integrates the use of prefixes in user input to determine which tutor attribute to search through. (i.e. `find n/alex`, `find s/A0123456X) **(chosen)**.
    - Pros: Better OOP practice as the resultant find commands are all subclasses of `FindByPrefixCommand`
    - Cons: Took more time to think of and implement.
- **Alternative 2:** Individual attributes of the tutor have their own find command (E.g. `findbyname`, `findbyemail`)
    - Pros: Easier to implement individual commands for each attribute.
    - Cons: Poor OOP practice the individual commands are all `find` commands and should not be a different class on its own. User also have more commands to remember.

### View Feature
<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `view` command involves operations within the UI to display/hide the tutor details panel. The communication between the logic and UI classes is facilitated by the `CommandResult` class, where the following field has been added:
- `CommandResult#isView` - Indicates if the current command is a `view` command.

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `view` command in the command box and how the view mechanism behaves at each step (omitting the parsing details).

Step 1: The user enters the command `view 1`.

Step 2: Upon parsing, a new `ViewCommand` based on the valid index.

Step 3: When the `ViewCommand` is executed, a new `CommandResult` with `isView` set to `true` is created and `ModelManager#tutorToView` is updated with the selected tutor.

Step 4: Upon recognising the `CommandResult` is of `isView` type, `MainWindow` calls `logic#getTutorToView()` to get the tutor to be displayed, which is passed into `MainWindow#handleView(Tutor tutor)`.

Step 5: This causes the `TutorDetailsPanel` of the `tutor` to be set as visible, resulting in the side panel being displayed.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):

![ViewSequenceDiagram](./images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: Method to pass a `Tutor` to UI**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the tutor to be viewed as a field in `Model` **(chosen)**.
  - Pros: Better OOP practice since `Model` handles all the data related to tutors.
  - Cons: The `tutorToView` may be null if there are no tutors in the list to be displayed, so more checks may be needed.

- **Alternative 2:** Store the tutor in `CommandResult`.
  - Pros: Easier to implement and fewer methods may be needed in `Logic` and `Model` as the tutor can be passed to
  the `MainWindow` directly through `CommandResult`.
  - Cons: Poor OOP practice as it does not make sense for `CommandResult` to store a `Tutor`, and other commands do not
  require a `Tutor` object to be stored.

### Sort Feature

This command sorts `Tuthub`'s displayed list based on quantitative measures, such as teaching nominations and ratings. Users are allowed to choose to sort in ascending or descending order.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `sort` command involves the logic, model, and UI part of Tuthub. Most updates are made within the `ModelManager`, which are:
- `ModelManager#sortedFilteredTutors` - A `javafx.collections.transformation.SortedList` that contains `ModelManager#filteredTutors`.
- `ModelManager#getFilteredTutorList()` - Now returns the `sortedFilteredTutors` list.
- `ModelManager#updateSortedTutorList(Comparator<Tutor>)` - Similar to `ModelManager#updateFilteredTutorList`, but updates the Comparator instead of predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `view` command in the command box and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `sort a r/`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `SortCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `SortCommandParser` to parse. The `SortCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (`order` and `prefix`) and creates the proper `Comparator` based on the user request.

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `SortCommand` is created based on the order, prefix, and comparator.

Step 4: In the `SortCommand` execution, the `model#updateSortedTutorList(Comparator<Tutor>)` is called upon with the proper `Comparator`. Then, a new `CommandResult` is created and stored in `LogicManager`.

Step 5: Upon recognising the `CommandResult`, `MainWindow` calls `logic#getFilteredTutorList()` to get the tutor cards to be displayed, which is passed as a constructor variable into `TutorListPanel`.

Step 6: Then, the `TutorListPanel` sets the items to view as the new and updated `sortedFilteredTutors` list.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):

![SortSequenceDiagram](./images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: The scope of `sort` (should it be able to sort filtered tutors or not?)**
- **Alternative 1:** Able to sort any `FilteredList` (i.e. the original tutor list or a tutor list after executing a `find` command) **(chosen)**.
    - Pros: The `sort` feature achieves its primary purpose while also having a defensive implementation, as it does not directly access and affect `Tuthub#UniqueTutorList`
    - Cons: Took more time to think of and implement.

- **Alternative 2:** `sort` redefines the original `Tuthub#UniqueTutorList`.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Feature becomes limited and lacking of purpose. Direct changes to original `Tuthub#UniqueTutorList` is less defensive.

**Aspect: Keeping track of sorting and filtering of the tutor list**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the `FilteredList` in the `SortedList` **(chosen)**.
    - Pros: Better OOP practice since the `FilteredList` and `SortedList` variables can be kept `final`.
    - Cons: Implementation is easy, but may be confusing to understand why and how it works.

- **Alternative 2:** Store two lists, one for `FilteredList` and one for `SortedList`.
    - Pros: Idea is more simply understood. Serves the main purpose of `sort` if implemented correctly.
    - Cons: Complicated to implement and possibility of many bugs. Poor OOP practice as it may require reassigning of the `FilteredList` and `SortedList` variables.

### Comment feature

This command adds a comment to a tutor in `Tuthub`'s displayed list.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `comment` command involves the logic and model part of Tuthub.
Most updates are made within the `ModelManager`, which are:

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `comment` command in the command box and how the comment is added to the tutor.

Step 1: The user enters the command `comment 1 c/Often late`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `CommentCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `CommentCommandParser` to parse.
The `CommentCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (`index` and `comment`).

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `CommentCommand` is created based on the index and the comment.

Step 4: In the `CommentCommand` execution, the `model#setTutor` is called upon with the `comment` added to the tutor. Then, a new `CommandResult` is created and stored in `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):

![CommentSequenceDiagram](./images/CommentSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: How are the comments stored?**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the comments as a list of comments, appending the comments to the list as needed. **(chosen)**
    - Pros: It is easier to add a `comment` and remove them from each tutor.
    - Cons: Took more time to think of and implement.

- **Alternative 2:** Store the `comment` as a string, replacing it everytime a new comment is added to the tutor.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: It is harder to add and remove comments from each tutor, as the previous comments need to be copied and then added manually by the user.
