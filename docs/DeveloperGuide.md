### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TutorListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Tutor` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TuthubParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a tutor).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TuthubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TuthubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores tuthub data i.e., all `Tutor` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tutor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutor>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Tuthub`, which `Tutor` references. This allows `Tuthub` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Tutor` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both tuthub data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TuthubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tuthubbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View Feature
<ins>Implementation</ins>

Similar to the `help` command, the `view` command involves operations within the UI to display/hide the tutor details 
panel. The communication between the logic and UI classes is facilitated by the `CommandResult` class, where the 
following field has been added:
- `CommandResult#isView` - Indicates if the current command is a `view` command.

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `view` command in the command box and how the view 
mechanism behaves at each step (omitting the parsing details).

Step 1: The user enters the command `view 1`.

Step 2: Upon parsing, a new `ViewCommand` based on the valid index.

Step 3: When the `ViewCommand` is executed, a new `CommandResult` with `isView` set to `true` is created and 
`ModelManager#tutorToView` is updated with the selected tutor.

Step 4: Upon recognising the `CommandResult` is of `isView` type, `MainWindow` calls `logic#getTutorToView()` to get the 
tutor to be displayed, which is passed into `MainWindow#handleView(Tutor tutor)`.

Step 5: This causes the `TutorDetailsPanel` of the `tutor` to be set as visible, resulting in the side panel being displayed.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):

![ViewSequenceDiagram](./images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: Method to pass a `Tutor` to UI**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the tutor to be viewed as a field in `Model` **(chosen)**.
  - Pros: Better OOP practice since `Model` handles all the data related to tutors. 
  - Cons: The `tutorToView` may be null if there are no tutors in the list to be displayed, so more checks may be needed.

- **Alternative 2:** Store the tutor in `CommandResult`.
  - Pros: Easier to implement and fewer methods may be needed in `Logic` and `Model` as the tutor can be passed to 
  the `MainWindow` directly through `CommandResult`.
  - Cons: Poor OOP practice as it does not make sense for `CommandResult` to store a `Tutor`, and other commands do not 
  require a `Tutor` object to be stored.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* tech-savvy tuition agents
* has to manage a significant number (up to hundreds) of tutor profiles
* seeks a more organised and systematic way of managing profiles as compared to excel sheets
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
* _Problem_: Multiple entries of the same tutor information as they have to repeatedly enter the same information when applying for different jobs
* _Solution_: Our tuthub detects duplicate tutor profiles and merges the additional information into the existing profile.
  <br/><br/>
* _Problem_: Too many tutors with no specific way to organise them systematically.
* _Solution_: Our tuthub can categorise the tutors based on different criteria and provides features to search for profiles easily.
